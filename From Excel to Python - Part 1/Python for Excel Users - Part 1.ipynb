    "# Python for Excel Users - Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is it for me?\n",
    "This tutorial notebook is for everyone who wants to get started working in python instead of Excel, e.g. for automating tasks or improving speed and scalability. Or for just the curious ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're at the right spot when you use Excel to combine various sheets or tables (using formulas like Index, Match, VLookup), use simple mathematical operations like sum and mean, or even use conditional aggregation functions (e.g. sum of transactions per category) or pivot tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal:\n",
    "We will explore and combine different sales data tables like we would in Excel. The tables are:\n",
    "- Orders\n",
    "- Order_lines\n",
    "- Products\n",
    "More details about the data below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements:\n",
    "While some basic experience with Python helps, you don't have to be a a programmer or data scientist to follow this tutorial. Ideally, you should have heard of pandas and jupyter notebook (which is where you're reading this tutorial right now) and spent some time with python yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "But don't get discouraged. Just try to follow along and read up on things we did not cover. You can always come back here. And if you need some personal guidance, we at HOSD Mentoring offer free one-to-one data mentoring at www.hosd-mentoring.com\n"

    "Imagine you just started in the sales department of a huge online retailer. It's your first day. You set up your computer, got a great double espresso from your company's barista aka. the old coffee machine in the break room, and you're read to get started! \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it's summer time and everyone in your team is on vacation. This leaves you with a lot of questions and time to **explore the company data yourself**. Great!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A few of the questions in your head are:\n",
    "- 🏬 How big is the company actually, measured by number of transactions? \n",
    "- 💵 Company size in terms of revenue per year? \n",
    "- 👗 How many products do we offer per Category? \n",
    "- 📦 How successful are our deliveries?\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that you can answer these questions simply by using and combining the three tables Orders, Order_lines, and Products in Excel using **standard formulas and a maybe a pivot table**. \n",
    "\n",
    "But since no one's arround and your starting of a new job marks a new era in your career, you want to do it differently this time. Why not try out this **cool thing called python** that everyone on LinkedIn talks about? Yeah, let's do that!"
